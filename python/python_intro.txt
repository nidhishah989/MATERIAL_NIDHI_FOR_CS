details: 

--> python is a general pupose language.
--> for machine learning, web development, artificial inteligent.
--> intedation require,
--> slow compare to other language, 
--> it is much productive for machine learning and artificial language.

--> it is easy to learn
--> it is open source langauge
--> modifiy the code is easy


USES:
--> GUI application
--> Web application
--> mobile apps
--> desktop application
--> service side code
--> Artificial Intelligent
--> machine learning algorithm


--> huge community who constantly make libraries and help those in need
--> the algorithms are ready to use , which increase productivity.

FEATURES OF PYTHON:
--> Simplicity
--> Open source
--> Portability (write and share is easy)
--> Embeddable and Extensible (covert other languages code into its, to run)
--> Interpreted
--> Huge Libraries
--> Object Oriented (for real world senario)

COMPANY USE PYTHON:
--> GOOGLE: BETTER SEARCH RESULT
--> DROPBOX: Cloud platform: THe server and client application are coded in python
--> NETFLIX: Machine learning is used to cluster users bashed on their interest on shows and retian them for longer
--> NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY of USA: cyber security analysis and other encryption and decryption work is done using python
--> BIT TORRENT: transfer of files between peer-to-peer which started out as a normal python FIle
--> NASA: Scientific calculation are computed using Python

LEARN PYTHON STEPS:
--> BASIC LEARNING:
   ----> Variable, data type, operators, arrays, flow control, methods, file handling, OOPS, practice


CAREER OPPORTUNITY:

--> WEB DEVELOPMENT and FRAMEWORKS (FRAMEWORKs: DJANGO, FLOWER)
--> GAME DEVELOPMENT
--> BIG DATA
--> WEB TESTING
--> AI/ DATA Science
--> SMART DEVICES(IOT)
--> SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
--> AUTOMATION
