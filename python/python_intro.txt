details: 

--> python is a general pupose language.
--> for machine learning, web development, artificial inteligent.
--> intedation require,
--> slow compare to other language, 
--> it is much productive for machine learning and artificial language.

--> it is easy to learn
--> it is open source langauge
--> modifiy the code is easy


USES:
--> GUI application
--> Web application
--> mobile apps
--> desktop application
--> service side code
--> Artificial Intelligent
--> machine learning algorithm


--> huge community who constantly make libraries and help those in need
--> the algorithms are ready to use , which increase productivity.

FEATURES OF PYTHON:
--> Simplicity
--> Open source
--> Portability (write and share is easy)
--> Embeddable and Extensible (covert other languages code into its, to run)
--> Interpreted
--> Huge Libraries
--> Object Oriented (for real world senario)

COMPANY USE PYTHON:
--> GOOGLE: BETTER SEARCH RESULT
--> DROPBOX: Cloud platform: THe server and client application are coded in python
--> NETFLIX: Machine learning is used to cluster users bashed on their interest on shows and retian them for longer
--> NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY of USA: cyber security analysis and other encryption and decryption work is done using python
--> BIT TORRENT: transfer of files between peer-to-peer which started out as a normal python FIle
--> NASA: Scientific calculation are computed using Python

LEARN PYTHON STEPS:
--> BASIC LEARNING:
   ----> Variable, data type, operators, arrays, flow control, methods, file handling, OOPS, practice
   ----> functions. exceptions, I/O operations, loops, control statments, conditional statements,
         Data structure, OOPs concepts, File handling ..
   ----> For master Web framework:: Django or flask, Tkinter for GUI bases web apps, MVC-MVT architecture, HTML, CSS
   ----> For data science:: Statistics, and applied maths, Data visualization, analysis, SQL,Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn,Data manipulation
   ----> Machine Learning and AI: machine learning algorithm, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, probability & statistic, Neural network, deep learning.
   ----> Deep Learning:: Neural network architecture, video, audio and language processing.
   ----> Miscellaneous:: OpenCV for computer vision, Web scrapping with Bs4, predictions models etc

Installation python::
1. Dowload latest python version
2. check in pop -up window, the add python ... to PATH should be selected, and then install python.
3. Make sure the path from PC->PROPERTIES-> ADVANCE SYSTEM SETTING->ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE-> CHECK PATH LINK: SHOULD BE PYTHON.
4. iF THE PYTHON PATH IS NOT THERE, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ADD THAT


nidhi version of python download.: command window:: type python:: if microsoft center is main source of software, it will open the app info for latest python version:: install that app:: it will set PATH itself
